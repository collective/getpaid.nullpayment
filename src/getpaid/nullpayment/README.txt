This is a payment processor for getpaid, which doesn't actually
process any payments. Its sole purpose is for testing other parts
of getpaid, without the hassle of setting up a merchant/dev account
with one of getpaid's supported payment processors.

For more information about payment processors, 
see `getpaid.paymentprocessors README <http://code.google.com/p/getpaid/source/browse/getpaid.paymentprocessors/trunk/README.txt>`_.
